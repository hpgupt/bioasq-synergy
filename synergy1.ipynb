Notably, paraquat and rotenone are two pesticides that have been associated with an increased risk of developing PD due to their effects on mitochondrial function and oxidative stress. Additionally, other pesticides, such as organochlorines, have also shown a correlation with PD in various studies. The evidence suggests that chronic exposure to these chemicals, especially in agricultural settings, may contribute significantly to the development of Parkinson's Disease.\"}, {'body': 'Is Lecanemab effective for early Alzheimer?s Disease?', 'type': 'yesno', 'id': '63adc8d8c6c7d4d31b000017', 'answer_ready': True, 'documents': ['36449413', '33865446', '37729908', '38730496', '36544184', '37357276', '37188886', '37213538', '36482412', '38484190'], 'snippets': [{'document': '36449413', 'beginSection': 'abstract', 'endSection': 'abstract', 'offsetInBeginSection': 2509, 'offsetInEndSection': 2677, 'text': \"lecanemab reduced markers of amyloid in early alzheimer's disease and resulted in moderately less decline on measures of cognition and function than placebo at 18 months\"}, {'document': '33865446', 'beginSection': 'abstract', 'endSection': 'abstract', 'offsetInBeginSection': 0, 'offsetInEndSection': 2373, 'text': 'at 18 months, 10-mg/kg biweekly lecanemab reduced brain amyloid while showing a drug-placebo difference in favor of active treatment by 27% and 30% on adcoms, 56% and 47% on adas-cog14, and 33% and 26% on cdr-sb versus placebo'}, {'document': '36544184', 'beginSection': 'abstract', 'endSection': 'abstract', 'offsetInBeginSection': 0, 'offsetInEndSection': 2047, 'text': 'lecanemab...has demonstrated robust brain fibrillar amyloid reduction and slowing of clinical decline in early ad'}, {'document': '37729908', 'beginSection': 'abstract', 'endSection': 'abstract', 'offsetInBeginSection': 0, 'offsetInEndSection': 183, 'text': \"recent aβ-immunotherapy trials have yielded the first clear evidence that removing aggregated aβ from the brains of symptomatic patients can slow the progression of alzheimer's disease\"}, {'document': '38730496', 'beginSection': 'abstract', 'endSection': 'abstract', 'offsetInBeginSection': 138, 'offsetInEndSection': 292, 'text': 'lecanemab, an fda-approved amyloid beta (aβ)-directed antibody indicated for the treatment of early ad, binds with high affinity to soluble aβ protofibrils'}, {'document': '37213538', 'beginSection': 'abstract', 'endSection': 'abstract', 'offsetInBeginSection': 1617, 'offsetInEndSection': 1750, 'text': 'lecanemab showed significant positive statistical efficacy with respect to cognition, function, and behavior in patients with early ad'}, {'document': '37188886', 'beginSection': 'abstract', 'endSection': 'abstract', 'offsetInBeginSection': 0, 'offsetInEndSection': 1944, 'text': \"the primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in the alzheimer's disease composite score (adcoms) at 12 months...showed a 29.7% slower decline than placebo for adcoms at 18 months\"}, {'document': '38484190', 'beginSection': 'abstract', 'endSection': 'abstract', 'offsetInBeginSection': 260, 'offsetInEndSection': 408, 'text': \"this study aims to quantify the cost-effectiveness of lecanemab and how it varies based on the accuracy of ad testing and individuals' apoe ε4 status\"}, {'document': '37357276', 'beginSection': 'abstract', 'endSection': 'abstract', 'offsetInBeginSection': 0, 'offsetInEndSection': 2431, 'text': 'lecanemab was generally well-tolerated in clarity ad, with no deaths related to lecanemab in the core study'}, {'document': '36482412', 'beginSection': 'abstract', 'endSection': 'abstract', 'offsetInBeginSection': 0, 'offsetInEndSection': 2184, 'text': 'lecanemab was beneficial to stabilize or slow down the decrease in cdr-sb'}], 'exact_answer': 'yes', 'ideal_answer': \"Lecanemab has shown effectiveness in early Alzheimer's disease, particularly in reducing amyloid burden and slowing cognitive decline.

Additionally, pathways related to phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis, as well as porphyrin metabolism, have been identified as significant in the context of neonatal sepsis. The interplay between metabolism and immune activation is also critical, with alterations in glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation being particularly relevant to the immune response in neonates. Understanding these pathways can aid in the early diagnosis and treatment of neonatal sepsis.\"}, {'body': 'Causes of borderline personality disorder.', 'type': 'list', 'id': '6777bebf592fa48873000015', 'answer_ready': True, 'documents': ['21195251', '29795363', '30840560', '15288745', '31573324', '24953109', '24791755', '36853248', '31574104', '19379027'], 'snippets': [{'document': '21195251', 'beginSection': 'abstract', 'endSection': 'abstract', 'offsetInBeginSection': 406, 'offsetInEndSection': 519, 'text': 'the causes are not yet clear, but genetic factors and adverse life events seem to interact to lead to the disorder'}, {'document': '30840560', 'beginSection': 'abstract', 'endSection': 'abstract', 'offsetInBeginSection': 615, 'offsetInEndSection': 718, 'text': 'but the condition can also arise from adverse post-natal factors: parental cruelty or neglect, or incest'}, {'document': '15288745', 'beginSection': 'abstract', 'endSection': 'abstract', 'offsetInBeginSection': 381, 'offsetInEndSection': 555, 'text': 'causal factors are only partly known, but genetic factors and adverse events during childhood, such as physical and sexual abuse, contribute to the development of the disorder'}, {'document': '24953109', 'beginSection': 'abstract', 'endSection': 'abstract', 'offsetInBeginSection': 131, 'offsetInEndSection': 240, 'text': 'the association with psychosocial factors is well established, however its neurobiology is not fully unraveled'}, {'document': '31574104', 'beginSection': 'abstract', 'endSection': 'abstract', 'offsetInBeginSection': 0, 'offsetInEndSection': 2453, 'text': 'to address the difficulty differentiating clinically distinct mdd from depressive symptoms that are integral to bpd psychopathology'}, {'document': '31573324', 'beginSection': 'abstract', 'endSection': 'abstract', 'offsetInBeginSection': 298, 'offsetInEndSection': 425, 'text': 'this paper briefly reviews the co-occurrence of bpd and depressive disorder and suggests ways of differentiating these disorders'}, {'document': '36853248', 'beginSection': 'abstract', 'endSection': 'abstract', 'offsetInBeginSection': 0, 'offsetInEndSection': 138, 'text': 'this jama patient page describes borderline personality disorder, its signs and symptoms, possible causes, diagnosis, and treatment options'}, {'document': '24791755', 'beginSection': 'abstract', 'endSection': 'abstract', 'offsetInBeginSection': 0, 'offsetInEndSection': 59, 'text': 'borderline personality disorder (bpd) affects 2.7% of adults'}, {'document': '19379027', 'beginSection': 'abstract', 'endSection': 'abstract', 'offsetInBeginSection': 917, 'offsetInEndSection': 1117, 'text': 'one probable pathway is identified that leads to borderline personality disorder; it begins with early vulnerability, expressed initially as impulsivity and followed by heightened emotional sensitivity'}, {'document': '29795363', 'beginSection': 'abstract', 'endSection': 'abstract', 'offsetInBeginSection': 482, 'offsetInEndSection': 678, 'text': 'bpd is characterized by extreme sensitivity to perceived interpersonal slights, an unstable sense of self, intense and volatile emotionality and impulsive behaviours that are often self-destructive'}], 'exact_answer': [['genetic predispositions'], ['adverse childhood experiences'], ['neurobiological factors'], ['maladaptive parenting']], 'ideal_answer': 'Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is believed to arise from a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors.
